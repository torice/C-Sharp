C# Code Examples
-----------------

Each program can be compiled, run and cleaned using make. To compile
a program from a bash prompt, just type:
make
then press enter. To run the application, type:
make run
then press enter. To clean up the files, type:
make clean
then press enter.

Each program is just a simple example of different features in C#.
