				and the driving force behind why it was created</abbr>. We also want to show you some of the

			<h3>What we've learned</h3>
			<p>
				Today we are here to share what we have learned about C#, why J++ no longer exists, and how C# is now
				Microsoft's magic script for keeping the .net dream alive. We'll show you some of it's tools,
				why it was created, and some examples of some C# code.

				Eight seconds later the Participation class div loads with it's first paragraph.
				Then the second paragraph loads, and so on.

				Important!: The explanation class only supports the two paragraphs.
				A third paragraph would load over top of the rest of the content making your

			<h3>Uses for C#</h3>
			<p>
				Since C# is a managed language, it ensures there aren't any memory leaks. In
				simple programs, this ensures the performance of the system the application is
				running on is optimized. For high end programs and applications, this can have
				a negative impact. For instance, games like Doom 3 and 4 would not work well
				if the code was written in C#. Enabling unsafe mode can improve calls between
				managed code. One scenario that requires unsafe mode is in the situation where
				a developer needs to use pointers.

			<h3>Uses for C#</h3>

				If we take a look at C# from the "30 thousand foot view" we can see that it
				borrows many concepts from Java, C, and C++. This makes the code look very
				familiar to most programmers but it was designed to be easier to use with
				syntax that allows the code itself to basically explain what it is doing. With
				a built in library containing many preconfigured functions, writing clean,
				readable, and portable code becomes much easier. With these features in mind
				and the fact that it is an object oriented language, it makes for an excellent
				language that can be used in rapid application deployment. RAD is a programming
				methodology somewhat similar to Agile.

				C# can be great for developing games and apps to deploy to the Windows App Store.
				Programs deployed to the App store can be available to both the Windows Operating Systems
				and the Windows Mobile platform. If you are looking to develop software for multiple
				platforms, C# could be an excellent choice.
				C# is also excellent for creating website and web applications. Microsoft developed
				Sharepoint in C#, one of the more resent additions to the Microsoft Office Suite.
				SharePoint is an Enterprise level webbased application. It allows organizations,
				departments, and teams to quickly and easily create entire websites in just a few
				minutes.
