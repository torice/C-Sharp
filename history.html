			<h3>What we've learned</h3>
			<p>
				Today we are here to share what we have learned about C#, why J++ no longer exists, and how C# is now
				Microsoft's magic script for keeping the .net dream alive. We'll also show you some of it's tools,
				why it was created, and some examples of some C# code. We also expect to give you a glimpse of the feud
				going on between Sun Systems and Microsoft.

				Eight seconds later the Participation class div loads with it's first paragraph.

			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				C# is an object-oriented language from Microsoft aimed at combining the
				power of C++ and Java. It is specifically designed to work with the
				Microsoft .NET platform.
			</p>
			<p>
				Microsoft describes it as an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language
				that enables developers the ability to build a variety of secure and robust
				applications based on the C# language and the .NET framework.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="participation" id="zen-participation" role="article">
			<h3>The Language</h3>
			<p>
				Microsoft introduces the C# syntax as highly expressive yet easy to learn. This is mostly
				due to the fact that looks and acts so much like Java. It does however have features that are
				not available in Java such as "nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, lambda expressions
				and direct memory access."
			</p>
			<p>
				C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance,
				and iteraters, which enable implementers of collection classes to defin custom iteration behaviors
				that are simple to use by client code.
			</p>
			<p>
				As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and plymorphism.
				With it's basic object oriented principles, C# makes it easy to develop software components through
				several innovative language constructs.

			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Automatic garbage collection</li>
				<li>Pointers are not required</li>
				<li>Declaration of functions and classes are not needed</li>
				<li>Classes can be defined within other classes</li>
				<li>No global functions or variables, everything belongs to a class</li>
				<li>All variables are automatically initialized to their default values but can be
				initialized manually using static constructors</li>
			</p>

			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<p>
				C# can be written in any text editor or IDE but Microsofts Visual Studio natively supports C#.
			</p>
			<p>
				C# Programs can be compiled and ran from within Visual Studio.
			</p>
			<p>
				C# is now fully supported on the Linux platform as well and can be compiled through the Make Utility.
			</p>
			<p>
				C# uses the .NET Framework Class Library making it very flexible and easy to use.
			</p>
			<p>
				On other hand, C# heavily relies on the .NET Framework.
